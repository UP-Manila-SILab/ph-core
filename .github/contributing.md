## PH Core Philosophy

### Mission Statement

> PH Core defines the **minimum data commonly required for health information exchange across the Philippine health system**, similar to AU Base and US Core approaches.

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **National Commonality** | PH Core captures data elements that are *commonly needed* across multiple Philippine health programs, facilities, and use cases—not specialized or program-specific data |
| **Foundation, Not Ceiling** | PH Core provides a **floor** (minimum baseline), not a ceiling. Program-specific IGs can extend PH Core with additional constraints |
| **Reuse and Alignment** | Elements in PH Core are those that have demonstrated reuse value across ≥2 implementation contexts |

### Comparison with Peer IGs

| IG | Philosophy |
|----|------------|
| **AU Base** | "A set of resources and profiles that define the common and base level requirements for Australian implementations" |
| **US Core** | "Defines the minimum set of constraints on the FHIR resources to create the US Core Profiles" |
| **PH Core** | "Defines the minimum expectations for data commonly exchanged across Philippine health systems" |

---

## Profile Inclusion Criteria

### Standard Rule: The ≥2 IG Rule

A resource or data element is eligible for PH Core when it is **used by 2 or more independent Implementation Guides** (IGs) or programs within the Philippine health system.

**Rationale:** This ensures PH Core contains only nationally reusable components, avoiding program-specific bloat while enabling true interoperability.

**Process:**
1. Identify data elements across local IGs (e.g., NHDR, eReferral, PhilHealth Claims, Facility Systems)
2. Map to base FHIR resources
3. If ≥2 IGs independently use the same element → candidate for PH Core
4. Profile the element with PH Core constraints

### Exception Rule: Human Appraisal

The ≥2 rule may be waived through **human appraisal** when:
- The element has **high national policy priority** (e.g., mandated by DOH JAO)
- The element **enables critical interoperability** despite limited current adoption
- The element is **essential for patient safety** or **regulatory compliance**
- The element is **foundational infrastructure** (e.g., identifiers, addresses)

### Documentation Requirement

When bypassing the ≥2 rule, the justification must be documented in:
1. The profile's FSH comments (e.g., `// Exception: Required by DOH JAO 2021-0002`)
2. The issue/PR description
3. The [Decision Log](#decision-log)

---

## Profile Development Rules

> 📝 **Note:** These rules represent the current team consensus as of the latest IG review cycle. They are subject to refinement as edge cases are identified and the IG matures.

### Rule Summary Table

| Rule | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Rule 1: Cardinality → Obligation Mapping** | Map cardinality to Must Support + Obligation | `1..1` → `ObligationRequired` |
| **Rule 2: CodeableConcept Optional** | Use `CodeableConceptSO` RuleSet | `* insert CodeableConceptSO(elementName)` |
| **Rule 3: CodeableConcept Required** | Declare explicitly, don't use SO | `* element 1..* MS` + explicit obligations |
| **Rule 4: Non-CodeableConcept Elements** | Always separate MS and obligation | `* element 0..1 MS` then `* element insert ObligationOptional` |
| **Rule 5: Sub-Element Obligations** | Parent = existence, Sub-elements = representation flexibility | `reaction.manifestation` (1..*) with flexible coding |

### Detailed Rules

#### Rule 1: Cardinality → Obligation Mapping

Map cardinality constraints to Must Support flags and obligation extensions:

```fsh
// Cardinality 1..1 with Must Support and Required obligation
* status 1..1 MS
* status insert ObligationRequired

// Cardinality 0..1 with Must Support and Optional obligation  
* birthDate 0..1 MS
* birthDate insert ObligationOptional
```

#### Rule 2: CodeableConcept Optional

For optional CodeableConcept elements, use the `CodeableConceptSO` RuleSet:

```fsh
// Optional CodeableConcept - uses RuleSet
* insert CodeableConceptSO(maritalStatus)
* insert CodeableConceptSO(contact.relationship)
```

#### Rule 3: CodeableConcept Required

For required CodeableConcept elements, declare explicitly without the RuleSet:

```fsh
// Required CodeableConcept - explicit declaration
* code 1..* MS
* code.text MS
* code.coding MS
* code insert ObligationRequired
```

#### Rule 4: Non-CodeableConcept Elements

For non-CodeableConcept elements, always separate Must Support and obligation declarations:

```fsh
// Non-CodeableConcept element
* birthDate 0..1 MS
* birthDate insert ObligationOptional

* gender 0..1 MS
* gender insert ObligationOptional
```

#### Rule 5: Sub-Element Obligations

For parent elements with sub-elements, the parent controls existence while sub-elements control representation flexibility:

```fsh
// Parent controls cardinality (must exist)
* reaction 0..* MS
* reaction insert ObligationOptional

// Sub-elements control representation (coding vs text)
* reaction.manifestation 1..* MS
* reaction.manifestation.text MS
* reaction.manifestation.coding MS
```

## Profile Reference Hierarchy

### Reference Priority Order

When profiles reference other resources, follow this priority:

1. **PH Core profiles FIRST** (when available)
2. **Base FHIR R4 resources SECOND** (when no PH Core profile exists)
3. **Document missing profiles** with comments like `// Add PHCoreX once available`

### Decision Flowchart

```
For each reference element (subject, encounter, performer, etc.):
├── Is there a PH Core profile for this resource type?
│   ├── YES → Reference PH Core first, then base FHIR if needed
│   └── NO  → Reference base FHIR only
└── Is PH Core profile planned but not yet available?
    ├── YES → Add comment: // Add PHCoreX once available (see issue #N)
    └── NO  → Use base FHIR reference only
```

### Example FSH Pattern

```fsh
// CORRECT: PH Core first, then base FHIR
* subject only Reference(PHCorePatient or Group)
* encounter only Reference(PHCoreEncounter)
* performer.actor only Reference(PHCorePractitioner or PHCorePractitionerRole or Device)

// CORRECT: With documentation for missing PH Core profile
* reasonReference only Reference(Condition or PHCoreObservation or PHCoreProcedure)
// Note: PHCoreCondition should be added when available
```

### How to Determine Valid Reference Choices

Contributors must **dynamically check** the base FHIR R4 documentation. Do NOT rely on static lists.

**Step 1: Check the FHIR R4 Documentation**
- **FHIR R4 Index**: https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/index.html
- **FHIR R4 Table of Contents**: https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/toc.html

Use the Table of Contents to find the resource page, then check the element's `Reference(...)` type.

**Step 2: Map to PH Core Equivalents**

If a PH Core profile exists, use it instead of base FHIR:

| Base FHIR | PH Core Equivalent |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `Patient` | `PHCorePatient` |
| `Encounter` | `PHCoreEncounter` |
| `Observation` | `PHCoreObservation` |
| `Condition` | `PHCoreCondition` |
| `Procedure` | `PHCoreProcedure` |
| `Practitioner` | `PHCorePractitioner` |
| `PractitionerRole` | `PHCorePractitionerRole` |
| `Organization` | `PHCoreOrganization` |
| `Location` | `PHCoreLocation` |
| `RelatedPerson` | `PHCoreRelatedPerson` |
| `ServiceRequest` | `PHCoreServiceRequest` |
| `Medication` | `PHCoreMedication` |
| `MedicationRequest` | `PHCoreMedicationRequest` |
| `Immunization` | `PHCoreImmunization` |
| `Task` | `PHCoreTask` |
| `Provenance` | `PHCoreProvenance` |

> ⚠️ **Important**: This list is a **sample**. Always check the [PH Core IG Artifacts](https://build.fhir.org/ig/UP-Manila-SILab/ph-core/artifacts.html) page for the current, complete list of available profiles. For any resource not listed there, use the base FHIR resource name directly.

## Registry Engagement Framework

### External Registries

PH Core integrates with Philippine national registries for identifiers and terminology:

| Registry | Data Type | Current Status | Engagement Model | Agreement Needed |
|----------|-----------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| **NHFR** | Facility codes | Endpoint identified | Terminology artifact | MOU or data use |
| **PhilHealth** | Member IDs, accreditation | NamingSystem exists | Canonical URL alignment | DOH coordination |
| **PhilSys** (PSA) | National ID | NamingSystem exists | Identifier validation | PSA agreement |
| **PRC** | License numbers | Not in PH Core | License verification | PRC data sharing |
| **BIR** | TIN for organizations | Not defined | Tax identifier use | BIR coordination |
| **DOH** | eHealth standards | Active collaboration | Governance authority | Formal mandate |

### Registry Engagement Principles

1. **Non-FHIR Registry Integration**: For registries without FHIR APIs, PH Core publishes NamingSystems and CodeSystems that reference the external registry's canonical identifiers.

2. **Governance Model**: Registry updates are coordinated through DOH-KMITS as the national health IT governance body. Changes to external code systems require registry owner approval.

3. **Versioning Strategy**: When external registries change their code sets:
   - Minor changes (new codes): Added in patch releases
   - Major changes (breaking): Coordinated with registry owner, announced in release notes
   - Deprecated codes: Marked with `inactive` status in CodeSystem

4. **Legal Framework**: 
   - **MOU required** for data sharing agreements (NHFR, PRC)
   - **DOH coordination** sufficient for government bodies (PhilHealth, PhilSys)
   - **Formal mandate** applies to DOH-published standards

5. **CodeSystem Publication**: PH Core publishes its own CodeSystems for:
   - Philippine government classifications (PSGC, PSOC, PSCED)
   - DOH-maintained code lists
   - Interim registries without FHIR endpoints

## Coding Style Guidelines

### **Follow these coding standards to ensure consistency across the project:**

#### FSH (FHIR Shorthand) Guidelines

* **Indentation:** Use 2 spaces for indentation in all FSH files when continuing lines. Top-level declarations have no indentation.
* **Line Length:** Limit lines to a maximum of 100 characters.
* **File Organization:** Flat structure preferred. Indent only for line continuations and nested elements.

#### Naming Conventions

PH Core follows **CamelCase with explicit suffixes** (established Feb-Mar 2026 via PR #139):

| Element Type | FSH Name Pattern | ID Pattern | File Pattern | Example |
|--------------|------------------|------------|--------------|---------|
| **Profile** | `PHCore{Resource}` | `ph-core-{resource}` | `ph-core-{resource}.fsh` | `PHCorePatient`, `ph-core-patient.fsh` |
| **Extension** | `{PascalCase}` | `{kebab-case}` | `{id}.fsh` | `IndigenousPeople`, `indigenous-people.fsh` |
| **CodeSystem** | `{Name}CS` or `{ACRONYM}` | `{kebab}-cs` or `{ACRONYM}` | `{name}.fsh` | `IndigenousGroupsCS`, `indigenous-groups.fsh` |
| **ValueSet** | `{Name}VS` or `{Plural}` | `{kebab}-vs` or `{plural}` | `{name}.fsh` | `Regions`, `regions.fsh` |
| **NamingSystem** | `{System}NS` | `{system}-ns` | `{system}-ns.fsh` | `PhilHealthIDNS`, `philhealth-id-ns.fsh` |
| **Example** | `{resource}-{scenario}-example` | (same as name) | `{id}.fsh` | `patient-single-example.fsh` |
| **Actor** | `{Noun}` | `{noun}` | `{noun}.fsh` | `Server`, `server.fsh` |
| **RuleSet** | `{PascalCaseDescription}` | (inline only) | `{description}.fsh` | `ObligationRequired`, `obligation.fsh` |
| **Alias (External)** | `${UPPERCASE}` | N/A | aliases.fsh | `$sct`, `$PSOC` |
| **Alias (Actor)** | `${lowercase}` | N/A | aliases.fsh | `$server`, `$creator` |

**Key Points:**
- Profile names use `PHCore` prefix (PascalCase)
- Extensions do NOT use PHCore prefix (implicitly PH Core)
- CodeSystems use `CS` suffix OR official acronym (PSOC, PSGC, PSCED)
- ValueSets use `VS` suffix OR simple plural noun (Regions, Provinces)
- NamingSystems use `NS` suffix
- Examples use `-example` suffix (changed from `-ex` via Issue #150)
- Aliases: external terminology = UPPERCASE, actors = lowercase (EU EPS pattern)

#### FSH File Organization

```fsh
// 1. Aliases (if any)
Alias: $loinc = http://loinc.org
Alias: $snomed = http://snomed.info/sct

// 2. Profile/Extension/Logical definition
Profile: PHCorePatient
Parent: Patient
Id: ph-core-patient
Title: "PH Core Patient Profile"
Description: "Philippine Core Patient Profile"

// 3. Rules - flat structure, * prefix
* identifier 1..*
* name 1..*
* insert CodeableConceptSO(maritalStatus)

// 4. Invariants (if any)
Invariant: ph-pat-001
Description: "Patient name must include family name"
Severity: #error
```

#### Comments

* Use `//` for inline comments where necessary.
* Add comments for complex rules or business logic.
* **TDG References:** Format as `// TDG Row REF-XX: "{element}" -> {FHIR path}`
* Ensure profiles and extensions have clear descriptions.

#### Testing

* Ensure your FSH compiles without errors using `sushi .`
* Expected result: `0 Errors, 0 Warnings`
* Provide examples for new profiles.
* Validate the IG builds successfully before submitting a PR.

## Branching Strategy

### **Branch Naming Conventions**

> **Important:** Branch names must **NOT** contain `/` or other special characters that may cause issues with the FHIR auto-IG builder (build.fhir.org).
>
> **Correct:** `feat-create-medication-series`, `fix-patient-profile`, `hotfix-build-error`
> **Incorrect:** `feat/create-medication-series`, `feature/update`, `bug_fix/validator`
>
> The auto-IG builder converts `/` to `-` in URLs, which can cause broken build links and failed IG previews.

### **Main Branches:**

* **main**: This branch contains the latest working code and is where new features are merged before going to production.
* **releases-tag**: These are tagged branches which contains versioned latest production ready code.

### **Feature Branches:**

* Create a feature branch from `main` for new features or bug fixes.
* Use the format: `{type}-{issue-number}-{description}` (e.g., `feature-272-contributing-md`, `fix-156-patient-binding`)
* Merge your feature branch back into `main` when your work is done, and submit a pull request.

### **Hotfix Branches:**

* If an urgent bug needs fixing in production, create a `hotfix-short-description` branch off `main`, fix the issue, then merge it back into `main`.

### **Release Branches:**

* When preparing a new production release, create a `v#.#.#` branch from `main`, after final adjustments and after testing.

---

## Process for Code Review

### After you submit a pull request, it will go through the following review process:

#### **Automated Checks:**

* Your code will be checked by automated tools (e.g., CI pipeline) for build success, SUSHI compilation, and validation checks.
* Ensure all checks pass before submitting the PR.

#### **Reviewer Assignment:**

* A project maintainer or other contributors will be assigned to review your PR. They will check for:
  * Code correctness and FHIR compliance.
  * Adherence to Coding Style Guidelines.
  * Potential issues with profiles, extensions, or examples.
  * Test coverage and functionality.
  * Correct canonical URLs and identifiers.

#### **Feedback:**

* You may receive feedback or requests for changes. Please address the comments by pushing additional commits to the same branch.
* For any non-code changes requested (e.g., documentation or formatting), make sure to fix them.

#### **Approval:**

* Once the review is complete and all feedback is addressed, the reviewer will approve the PR.

#### **Merging:**

* After approval, the PR will be merged into the target branch `main`.
* The PR will be **squash merged** to maintain a clean commit history.

#### **Post-Merge:**

* After the merge, ensure any linked issues are automatically closed by the PR.
* Delete the feature branch after merge.

#### **Reviewer Checklist**

* Does the IG build locally and in CI?
* Are new artifacts linked in the IG?
* Are identifiers and canonical URLs correct?
* Are changes documented in PR notes?
